                    <p>Emmanuel Zapata is an impending graduate in Computer Science and Chemistry from the University of Virginia, poised to embark on a career in technology. As a dedicated first-generation college student, he possesses a profound curiosity about technology and the physical sciences. His focus is on exploring the complexity of Software and its intersectionality with other fields, as well its integration with Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence via the building and iteration of it.
                        He is also extremely interested in data collection and analysis, as he has always been a big fan of the New York Yankess growing up and the stat-centric focus of Major League Baseball. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Emmanuel seeks to further his commitment to lifelong learning and make meaningful contributions, notably to the first-generation community. He envisions using his expertise to not only innovate but also to inspire and support others from similar backgrounds.</p>
                    
                    <p>Emmanuel is open to connecting with tech professionals, mentors, and recruiters for advice, opportunities, and collaborative discussions. Feel free to reach out or connect with him on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuel-zapata-3569741b1/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or via email at <a href="mailto:emmanuel.zapata010+work@gmail.com">emmanuel.zapata010+work@gmail.com</a>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Outside of his academic pursuits, Emmanuel balances his life with interests in weightlifting, bartending, volunteering, and following various sports.</p>

                    <p>Emmanuel is also interested in traveling the world. He has gone to several countries, including Colombia, Italy, Spain, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Croatia.</p>

                    <p> His main goal is to travel all around the world and be able to provide an impact to respective communities. He has served as an advisor for a 501(c)-3 organization, Circle Match, his first two years of college.
                         He helped connect driven students from low-income communities with the college-going process by providing near-peer college advising. 
                        Rather than charging students, he helped to empower them to return to Circle Match and pay it forward in their own communities.
